   - **Data**: Time taken for each section/unit of a test.
   - **Purpose**: Break down time efficiency in different parts of the test.

### **11. Attempt Frequency Analysis**
   - **Graph Type**: Bar Graph or Heatmap
   - **Data**: Frequency of attempts by topic or question type.
   - **Purpose**: Show which topics are being revisited frequently, indicating either interest or struggle.

### **12. Correct vs. Incorrect Answer Patterns**
   - **Graph Type**: Stacked Bar Chart
   - **Data**: Number of correct and incorrect answers for each session.
   - **Purpose**: Easily compare correct and incorrect responses.

### **13. Subject/Unit/Chapter/Topic Drill-Down**
   - **Graph Type**: Sunburst or Treemap
   - **Data**: Performance metrics organized hierarchically.
   - **Purpose**: Allow users to drill down from broader subjects to specific topics to analyze their performance.

### **14. Time Allocation per Section**
   - **Graph Type**: Pie Chart
   - **Data**: Distribution of total time spent across different sections or topics.
   - **Purpose**: Help users see where they are investing most of their time.

### **15. Overall Test Summary**
   - **Graph Type**: Summary Dashboard
   - **Data**: Combine multiple charts showing key performance indicators (KPIs) like total score, average accuracy, and time taken.
   - **Purpose**: Provide a quick overview of the userâ€™s performance in one glance.

### **16. Progress Towards Goals**
   - **Graph Type**: Progress Bars or Milestone Charts
   - **Data**: Track progress towards specific goals set by the user (e.g., reaching 80% accuracy).
   - **Purpose**: Motivate users by visually showing progress.

### **17. Answer Change Analysis**
   - **Graph Type**: Flow Diagram
   - **Data**: Track how often answers were changed from correct to incorrect or vice versa.
   - **Purpose**: Show how second-guessing impacts performance.

### **18. Session Summary Snapshots**
   - **Graph Type**: Infographic Layout
   - **Data**: Highlight key stats from each session, like best-performing topic, highest time taken, etc.
   - **Purpose**: Offer a visually appealing summary of each test session.

### **19. Customizable Analysis Filters**
   - **Graph Type**: Interactive Charts (using libraries like Plotly)
   - **Data**: Allow users to filter analysis by date ranges, question types, difficulty, etc.
   - **Purpose**: Provide a personalized and deep dive into performance metrics.

### **20. Heatmap of Test Attempts**
   - **Graph Type**: Calendar Heatmap
   - **Data**: Frequency of test attempts over time.
   - **Purpose**: Visually identify when the user is most active in taking tests.
